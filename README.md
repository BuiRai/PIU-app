# PIU-app
Nothing to do, really, i have NOTHING to do
### Before
On the project root folder you need install all dependencies and plugins with the command ```npm install```.

After install all the dependencies, you need run one of the next commands:<br>
* Run the command: ```ionic serve``` to execute the application on the web browser.<br>
* Run the command: ```ionic serve -a [host] -p [port]``` to execute the application on a specific port and host.<br>
